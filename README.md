#Neural networks and deep learning
-------------

This is the repo for the *neural networks and deep learning study group* run by the Cambridge University Data Science Society. We follow the online textbook (neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com), 1 chapter per week, and meet Thursday nights in Trinity College.

Some notes on the chapters are available, as well as `Jupyter notebooks` for playing around with the textbook's neural network implementation.

Raquel, Katya and Souradip have also contributed by writing up notes and an OOP in Python tutorial.
